This repository contains data and script for figures and results of sea-level change in the Indicators of Global Climate Change 2024 paper, submitted to Earth System Science Data.

Files named 'AR6' are data files from IPCC AR6 Chapter 9, Fox-Kemper et al., 2021. 
Files with IGCC24 combine the AR6 data (up to 2018) with satellite altimetry information of sea-level change from 2019 onwards.
